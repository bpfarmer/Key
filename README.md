##key : share freely##

####About Key####
Key helps people navigate their digital lives freely, securely and privately. 

Key is built on top of the FreeKey encryption protocol, which is a descendant of the OTR protocol, based on the axolotl protocol designed by Open Whisper Systems and Trevor Perrin.

FreeKey is designed to offer strong encryption, perfect forward secrecy, and replay protection, and relies on:

- C25519 for Public/Private Key generation 
- C25519 for DHE 
- Ed25519 for signatures
- HMAC for message authentication
- AES-256 for encryption

####Running Locally####

- Run `$ pod install`
