##key : share freely##

####About Key####
Key helps people navigate their digital lives freely, securely and privately. 

Key is built on top of the FreeKey encryption protocol, which is a derivation of the OTR protocol, based on the axolotl protocol designed by Open Whisper Systems and Trevor Perrin.

FreeKey is designed to offer strong encryption, perfect forward secrecy, and replay protection, and relies on:

- EC-25519 for Public/Private Key generation 
- ECDH for Shared-Key Agreement 
- ECDSA for signing
- SHA-256 for MAC generation and verification
- AES-128 for encryption

####Running Locally####

- Run `$ pod install`
- CocoaPods will generate a new Key.xcworkspace file
- Open the new Key.xcworkspace file
